## Electronic-Voting-Machine

# Abstract

It is debatable if current direct-recording electronic voting machines can suï¬ƒciently be trusted for a use in elections. Reports about malfunctions and possible ways of manipulation have been in news in the last year. The issues have been raised in the parliament also. Voting schemes have to fulfill seemingly contradictory requirements: On one hand the election pro-cess should be verifiable to prevent electoral fraud and on the other hand each vote should be deniable to avoid coercion and vote buying. In this paper, I considered some of the problems, if not all, that are present in the current election system in India. I identified poor practices in the commissioning, development operation and scrutiny of the system and then present the suggestions for improving the system.
